                <p>A website's layout and design are created by a web designer. Simply said, a website designer improves how a site looks. To produce graphic components, they employ design software. Website designers typically have UI, or user interface, experience, which enables them to carefully build a site that is user-friendly and simple to browse.</p><br>
                <p>Sometimes, web designer and web developer are used synonymously, however this is incorrect. A highly specialised position, web development concentrates on the back-end creation of a website, employing programming languages to turn the online design into a functional reality.</p><br>
                <p>The popularity of touchscreen phones and tablets has necessitated a change in how websites are designed, with the web designer now having to make sure that web pages are responsive regardless of the device being used. As a result, it has become crucial to test websites at various phases of development and on a range of gadgets.</p>
                <p>As a result, businesses are placing increasing value on website design, which is mirrored in the employment landscape.</p><br><hr><br>
                <div class="text-2xl">Educational Qualification/Skills Required:-</div><br>
                <p>Every web designer has a unique personality. As artists, they are frequently imaginative, intuitive, sensitive, outspoken, and expressive people. They lack structure and are unique, unconventional, and innovative. Some of them are also entrepreneurial, which means they are risk-takers, goal-getters, forceful, extroverted, vivacious, enthusiastic, assured, and upbeat.</p><br>
                <p>There are several ways to enter the field of web design. It's not always required to get a formal degree because some organisations place a higher importance on innovation and experience. Larger firms, particularly those that provide graduate training programmes, may, nevertheless, demand a comparable undergraduate or graduate degree.</p><br>
                <p>Relevant degree subjects (with either a creative or technical element) are numerous, but could include computer science, digital media production, graphic design, content management skils, etc.</p><br><hr><br>
